# Pre-trained GoogLeNet for Image Classification

This project demonstrates image classification using the pre-trained **GoogLeNet** model from PyTorch on a custom dataset for **Bean Leaf Lesion Classification from Kaggle**.

## Highlights

- Uses the **GoogLeNet** model pre-trained on ImageNet.
- Compares performance between:
  - **Frozen GoogLeNet** (only final fully connected layer trained).
  - **Fine-tuned GoogLeNet** (all layers trainable).
- Applied on **Bean Leaf Lesion** dataset for detecting plant diseases.
- Visualizations and training evaluation techniques included.

## Model Comparison: Frozen vs. Fine-tuned

### 1. Frozen Model (`requires_grad = False`)
- Only the final classification layer is updated.
- Pre-trained on ImageNet (general images like dogs, cars).
- **Drawback**: Cannot capture specific features like leaf lesions.
- **Performance**: ~50â€“60% accuracy due to poor domain adaptation.

### 2. Fine-tuned Model (`requires_grad = True`)
- Entire model is trainable.
- Leverages pre-trained weights but adapts all layers to the specific task.
- **Performance**: 80â€“94% accuracy with faster convergence and better feature learning.
